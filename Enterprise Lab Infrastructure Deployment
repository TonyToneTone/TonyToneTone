GitHub Portfolio Project: Enterprise Lab Infrastructure Deployment
📌 Project Overview
This project documents the end-to-end deployment of a localized enterprise environment. It involves the virtualization of a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller and a Windows 11 Pro workstation, culminating in a fully integrated Active Directory Forest.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Hypervisor: Oracle VM VirtualBox 7.x

Server OS: Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience)

Client OS: Windows 11 Pro (Upgraded from Home SKU)

Services: Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DNS, IPv4 Networking

📂 Phase 1: Virtualization & Hardware Abstraction
Objective: Establish the virtual hardware foundation for the lab.
1. Virtual Machine Provisioning:

Allocated 4GB RAM / 2 vCPUs for both Server and Client nodes.

Troubleshooting (Critical): Resolved VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED by enabling Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x) in the host BIOS.

2. Optimization:

Installed VirtualBox Guest Additions on both nodes to enable WDDM graphics drivers and bidirectional clipboard functionality.

🌐 Phase 2: Networking & Infrastructure (The Dual-Homed Server)
Objective: Configure a secure, isolated network with internet reach-back.
1. Network Architecture:

Adapter 1 (Host-Only): Private LAN for internal Domain traffic (172.16.0.0/24).

Adapter 2 (NAT): External WAN access for updates and DNS forwarding.

2. Static IP Configuration:

Manually assigned 172.16.0.1 to the Domain Controller.

NCSI Troubleshooting: Resolved a "No Internet" taskbar glitch by adjusting Interface Metrics to prioritize the NAT gateway over the Host-Only adapter.

🏛️ Phase 3: Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
Objective: Establish the Forest Root and Identity Authority.
1. Server Promotion:

Promoted LAB-DC-01 to a Domain Controller for the [YourDomain].local forest.

Configured DNS Forwarders (8.8.8.8) to allow internal clients to resolve external web addresses.

2. Directory Structure (OU Design):

Created a logical hierarchy to mimic a corporate environment:

LAB_ACCOUNTS: For user identity management.

LAB_GROUPS: For security group nesting and GPO application.

💻 Phase 4: Client Integration & SKU Management
Objective: Successfully join a modern workstation to the domain.
1. SKU Upgrade (Home to Pro):

Issue: Windows 11 Home does not support Domain Joins.

Solution: Performed an in-place upgrade to Windows 11 Pro using a generic configuration key to unlock enterprise networking features.

2. The Domain Join:

Pointed Client DNS to 172.16.0.1.

Successfully joined Win11VM_1 to the domain.

Verification: Confirmed the new computer object appeared in the Computers container in ADUC.

📊 Verification & SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
How to Verify System Health:
Identity: Run whoami on the workstation to confirm DOMAIN\User context.

Connectivity: Run nslookup to ensure the DC is resolving the domain name.

Authentication: Log in with a newly created user from the LAB_ACCOUNTS OU to verify roaming profile creation.

🧠 Key Competencies Gained
Systems Administration: Managing Server Roles and AD DS lifecycle.

Network Engineering: Implementing Static IP schemas and Dual-NIC routing.

Troubleshooting: Root-cause analysis for BIOS, Licensing, and DNS conflicts.

Technical Writing: Developing professional documentation for a GitHub portfolio.
